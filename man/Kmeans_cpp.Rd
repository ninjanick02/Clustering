\title{K-Means Clustering (C++ Implementation)}
\usage{
Kmeans_cpp(X, centers, max_iter = 100, tol = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of data. Each row is an observation, and each
column is a variable.}

\item{centers}{Either the number of clusters (k) or a matrix of initial
cluster centers.}

\item{max_iter}{The maximum number of iterations allowed. Default is 100.}

\item{tol}{The tolerance for convergence. The algorithm stops if the sum of
squared distances between old and new centers is less than this value.
Default is 1e-4.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{centers}{A matrix of the final cluster centers.}
\item{cluster}{A vector of integers (from 1:k) indicating the cluster
  to which each point is allocated.}
\item{iter}{The number of iterations performed.}
\item{withinss}{A vector of the within-cluster sum of squares for each
  cluster.}
\item{tot.withinss}{The sum of all `withinss`.}
}
\description{
Performs k-means clustering on a numeric matrix using Lloyd's algorithm
with a high-performance C++ backend via Rcpp. This implementation is
recommended for larger datasets where performance is critical.
}
\details{
This function uses a C++ implementation of Lloyd's algorithm for improved
performance compared to the pure R implementation. The core iteration loop
runs in compiled C++ code, making it significantly faster for large datasets.

Empty clusters are handled by re-initializing them to random data points.

The algorithm stops when either:
- Cluster assignments no longer change, or
- The sum of squared distances between old and new centers is less than `tol`, or
- The maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`) is reached.

\examples{
# Use the iris dataset
X_iris = as.matrix(iris[, 1:4])

# Run k-means with k=3
set.seed(123)
result = Kmeans_cpp(X_iris, centers = 3, max_iter = 100, tol = 1e-4)
print(result$centers)

# Use custom initial centers
initial = X_iris[c(1, 50, 100), ]
result2 = Kmeans_cpp(X_iris, centers = initial)
